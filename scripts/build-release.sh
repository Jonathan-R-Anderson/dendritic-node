# P16 / T16.1 — the manifest.

# This used to end here, with seven binaries and nothing else: no checksums, no
# manifest, no signature. `scripts/update-from-github.sh` then installed
# whatever the network returned. §18.14 names the update channel as the
# strongest adversary against a real deployment and it was completely open.
#
# The manifest is written UNSIGNED. Signing is a separate step, run by a
# keyholder, deliberately NOT here: a signing key on the build machine belongs
# to whoever has compromised the build.

#
# An unsigned manifest is refused by the verifier with "release is unsigned", so
# shipping one by mistake fails closed rather than silently skipping the check.
