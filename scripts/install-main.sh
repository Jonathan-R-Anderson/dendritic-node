#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Install dendritic-node, its runtime dependencies, and a boot service.
#
# LINUX ONLY -- refused at the top rather than half-supported.
#
# Reached through scripts/install.sh, a POSIX-sh shim that installs bash first
# on systems that have none (Alpine). Run this file directly only if you know
# bash is present.
#
# Two service managers are supported, systemd and OpenRC, because Alpine has no
# systemd and boot-start is the whole point of the default install. Everything
# outside install_unit/start_docker is manager-agnostic.
#
# NETWORKING NEEDS NOTHING FROM THIS SCRIPT. The node carries its own anonymity
# overlay (AXON) inside the binary: no separate daemon to install, nothing to
# wait for, no proxy to configure. It fetches its seed relays from the signed
# bootstrap document over direct HTTPS and retries joining with backoff on its
# own, so the service has no readiness dependency to order after.
#
# BUSYBOX: Alpine's coreutils are busybox applets. That rules out `useradd`,
# `runuser`, `sudo`, GNU-style `adduser` flags, `install -o` with a numeric id,
# and `--` end-of-options on `install`. Each is handled where it appears; none
# of them is assumed.
#
# bash, not sh, for arrays and /dev/tcp: the port-clash checks open a TCP socket
# without nc, socat or python, none of which are guaranteed on a fresh server.
#
# Shape: DETECT -> REPORT -> ASK -> ACT, never interleaved. Nothing in DETECT
# writes to the machine, which is what makes --check honest: not a second code
# path, just this pass with ACT cut off.
#
# CHECK/ACT PARITY is the property everything rests on. Every "install" row maps
# to one DO_* flag set in DETECT and consumed by one ACT function:
#
#   PKGS[]              -> package rows          -> install_packages
#   DO_ENABLE_DOCKER    -> Docker Engine         -> start_docker
#   DO_BOOTSTRAP_GO     -> Go toolchain          -> bootstrap_go
#   DO_BUILD_BINARY     -> dendritic-node binary -> build_binary
#   DO_CREATE_USER      -> service account       -> create_user_and_dirs
#   DO_ADD_DOCKER_GROUP -> docker group          -> add_docker_group,
#                                                    install_compute_dropin
#   INSTALL_SERVICE     -> boot service, data directory
#
# Add an action, add its row. A --check that under-promises is a lie.
#
# The same rule covers VALUES, not just actions: --check prints the data_dir it
# resolved and the exact ReadWritePaths= line the unit will carry. A plan that
# names one directory while the unit sandboxes another is the same lie in a
# shape nobody thinks to check.

# Deliberately NOT `set -o pipefail`. Detection is full of pipelines whose
# reader exits early on purpose (`| grep -q`, `| grep -m1`), sending SIGPIPE to
# the writer, which pipefail then reports as a failed pipeline. Not
# hypothetical: with pipefail on, the /proc/cpuinfo check reported "CPU reports
# no vmx/svm" on a CPU that HAS vmx. -E so the ERR trap reaches functions.

dendritic-node installer (Linux)

Start here, and come back here when something breaks:

    ./scripts/install.sh --check

--check runs every detection, prints what is present, missing, installable and
IMPOSSIBLE here, then exits without touching the machine. Same code the
installer itself uses.

To install:

    sudo ./scripts/install.sh                 # asks before changing anything
    sudo ./scripts/install.sh --yes           # same plan, no questions

Options:
  --check, --dry-run   Report only. No packages, no files, no services.
  --yes, -y            Do not prompt for consent.
  --no-service         Do not create/enable the boot service. Boot-start is the
                       DEFAULT; this is the opt-out.
  --with-compute       Also prepare Docker (and the microVM path) for the
                       compute/DCS role. Not needed just to make an EXISTING
                       config work: if config.json already sets dcs.enabled
                       (with dcs.role.worker) or compute.enabled, the installer
                       sees that and fixes the service account's Docker access
                       on its own -- it just will not INSTALL Docker unless you
                       ask here.
  --binary PATH        Use this binary instead of discovering or building one.
  --data-dir PATH      Node data directory (default: /var/lib/rabbiit). Must
                       be >=2 components deep, outside system directories, and
                       either new, empty, or already owned by the service user.
  --payout 0x...       Payout address. Without one the node earns nothing, and
                       a headless server has no other way to set it (the
                       management page binds loopback).
  --capacity-gib N     Disk to donate, whole GiB (node default: 20). Checked
                       against real free space, which the node never does.
  --ui-listen ADDR     Management page address, or "off". A port clash here is
                       fatal to the WHOLE node (the listener calls log.Fatal),
                       so this is the escape hatch when 9090 is taken.
  -h, --help           This text.

Networking needs no setup: the AXON overlay is built into the node, which
finds its seed relays itself. Relaying for other nodes is off by default; to
offer it, set axon.relay and axon.listen in config.json and make that port
reachable from the internet (firewall rule / NAT forward).

gateway-only and probe-only nodes are configured by setting run_mode in
config.json (see GATEWAY.md); they are out of scope here.

Exit: 0 ok; 1 required dependency missing (--check) or install failed; 2 usage.

# --- the data directory contract --------------------------------------------
# This is the ONE path the installer takes ownership of (chown to the service
# account, chmod 0700), and it is caller-supplied, so it is validated like an
# attack surface. Four rules, each blocking the worst case on its own:
#   1. absolute, no "..", and only characters a systemd unit can express;
#   2. >=2 components deep, so it can never be a filesystem or mount root;
#   3. not inside a system directory;
#   4. (detect_data_dir) if it exists it must be a real directory that is
#      either EMPTY or ALREADY OWNED by the service account -- the rule that
#      makes "--data-dir /home/alice" impossible rather than discouraged.
# The chown is never recursive, so a mistake past all four touches one inode.
#
# Rules 1-3 are a function rather than a run of `case`s because a SECOND path
# has to pass them: the data_dir read out of a config file that already exists
# (see resolve_runtime_data_dir). One copy of the rules means the config path

#
# on a mount that was demonstrably rw, because ProtectSystem=strict makes
# EVERYTHING read-only except ReadWritePaths, and ReadWritePaths named the
# directory this installer had planned to create instead. The error names the
# filesystem, so it sends the operator to check mounts and permissions; nothing
# in it points at systemd. That is what these functions exist to prevent.
#
# NO jq. It is absent on most fresh servers, and an installer that needs a
# JSON parser installed before it can read a config file is not an installer.
