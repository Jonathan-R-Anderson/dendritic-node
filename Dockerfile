# The same binary volunteers run, deployed as a cluster workload. It does two
# jobs the network currently has nobody to do:
#
#   1. THE STABLE BOOTSTRAP PEER. The well-known document currently publishes
#      "peers": [], so no volunteer can discover another. This node has a
#      persistent AXON identity and is always up, so it is the anchor every
#      other node dials first.
#
#   2. THE S3 GATEWAY the backend offloads to (DHT_S3_ENDPOINT). Objects written
#      here are encrypted, erasure-coded and pushed out to volunteers.
#
# CGO_ENABLED=0 and a static build, so the runtime image needs no libc and the
# binary is the only moving part.
