// Filing the P12 evidence that needs no new measurement — roadmap phase 1.
//
// Three of the six terms are already answered and were simply never filed:
//
//	reorg depth        18 mainnet observations already gathered by the observer
//	watchtower outage  an operational commitment, which is a promise not a probe
//	(envelope)         the deployment those two are stated FOR
//
// This files them through the repository's own validation code and prints what
// remains. It measures nothing, spends nothing, and sends no transaction.
//
// WHY A RUNNER AND NOT A TEST
// ---------------------------
// The evidence has to exist outside a test binary to be worth anything, and the
// numbers below have to be reproducible by somebody who was not here. Running
// this prints every input it used.
//
//	go run ./cmd/p12-evidence -events /home/bruns/p12-reorg/data/events.jsonl
//
// Add -file to actually record; without it this is a dry run, because filing a
// wrong number into a derivation that ends in an immutable constructor argument
// is not something to do by accident.
