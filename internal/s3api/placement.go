// THE LEDGER OVER HTTP
// ====================
// The placement ledger knows which peer holds which shard, and nothing could
// read it. Not the S3 gateway, not the DCS bridge, not the loopback dashboard --
// so the site's admin purge page printed "?" for holder counts and derived shard
// counts by arithmetic on the object's size.
//
// WHY HERE AND NOT THE DASHBOARD
// ------------------------------
// The loopback dashboard is unreachable from the site three times over: the
// Service publishes only port 9000, the NetworkPolicy admits only port 9000, and
// config.go refuses a publicly-routable ui_listen. The S3 gateway is the only
// site->node channel that exists, it already has TLS and SigV4, and the site
// already builds a client for it. Exposing the ledger as an S3 QUERY
// SUBRESOURCE -- the same extension pattern the gateway already uses for
// ?policy, ?delete, ?uploads, ?uploadId -- costs no new port, no new
// credential, no NetworkPolicy edit and no second client on the site.
//
// AUTH, EXPLICITLY
// ----------------
// ServeHTTP skips SigV4 for GET/HEAD of an object in a public-read bucket, and
// it never looks at the query string. A ?placement subresource would therefore
// have been UNAUTHENTICATED on arcade, static and releases. These routes are
// listed in placementQuery() and the bypass is refused for them by name: this
// surface exposes what the node stores and can destroy it, so it is always
// signed.

// Recaller is the half of recall that needs the p2p node (streams to peers), so
// it is injected rather than reached for: the gateway is constructed with a
// *store.Store and nothing else.
