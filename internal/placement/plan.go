// Package placement decides WHICH node each shard of a chunk goes to.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS FIXES
// ----------------------
// Erasure coding buys nothing unless the shards it produces end up in different
// failure domains. The node split every 1 MiB chunk into 6 data + 3 parity
// shards and then wrote all nine to its own disk; the later "distribute" pass
// handed them out with `peers[shardNumber % len(peers)]`, which only yields nine
// distinct holders by accident when nine or more peers happen to be connected.
// With five peers, peers 0..3 each received two shards of every chunk, so a
// single node loss consumed two of the three parity shards and two losses
// destroyed the object. The arithmetic looked like 6+3 and behaved like 6+1.
//
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE GUARANTEES
// ----------------------------
// Plan never assigns two shards of the SAME chunk to the same peer, and never
// assigns a shard to a peer already known to hold a shard of that chunk. If
// there are fewer usable peers than unplaced shards it returns FEWER
// assignments rather than doubling up: an unplaced shard is a visible deficit
// the repair loop can retire later, whereas a doubled-up shard is a durability
// claim that is quietly false.
//
// It is deliberately pure — no libp2p, no store, no I/O — because the property
// that matters ("no two shards of a chunk share a host") is a property of the
// assignment, and it should be testable without standing up a network.

// Plan refuses to create co-location, but it cannot undo it, and rows written

// objects sharing a content-addressed shard) can arrive already crowded. Every
// shard has a holder, so an ordinary plan finds nothing to do: the object would
// sit in the queue forever, correctly counted as under-replicated and never
// getting any better. This is the one move that improves it.
//
// Nothing is forgotten. The crowded peer stays a holder in the ledger and keeps
// serving reads; what changes is that the index stops depending on it alone.
//
// A shard is only surplus against a DIFFERENT shard: a chunk of uniform bytes
// produces several indexes with the same content address, and a peer holding
// those bytes once holds all of them. Re-sending the same shard id to another
// peer would be paying for a copy that buys nothing.
