// Package compute detects what a node can compute with, and measures it.
//
// This is M1 of roadmap/gpgpu-roadmap.md — the foundation every later milestone
// prices against. A scheduler cannot place work without knowing what is here,
// and a marketplace cannot pay for it without knowing what it is worth.
//
// TWO RULES THIS PACKAGE IS BUILT AROUND
// --------------------------------------
// **Measure, do not read the model number.** A throttled laptop i7 and a
// datacentre i7 report the same name and differ by a factor of several in
// sustained throughput; a GPU's advertised TFLOPS is a spec-sheet peak nothing
// reaches. So every performance figure here comes from actually running
// something (see bench.go), and the identifying strings are labels for humans
// rather than inputs to scheduling.
//
// **A capability record is a CLAIM, not a fact.** Nothing here is trusted: a
// node can lie about any of it. That is deliberately not solved with
// attestation, which would mean trusted hardware and an enrolment problem.
// It is solved economically — a node that overstates itself takes work it
// cannot finish, misses deadlines, and loses reputation. The correction is in
// M8, not here.
//
// NO CGO, DELIBERATELY
// --------------------
// Detection reads sysfs and shells out to vendor tools that may or may not
// exist. It does NOT link NVML, ROCm or Level Zero. Linking them would give
// richer data and make the node unbuildable without vendor SDKs present, on a
// binary whose entire job is to run on other people's machines. A node with no
// GPU must build and run as easily as one with four.
