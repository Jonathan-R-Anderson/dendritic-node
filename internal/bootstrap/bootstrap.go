// Package bootstrap finds a way into the DHT without depending on one host.
//
// A joining node has no peers, so it cannot ask the network anything — that is
// what bootstrap is for. It has to learn two things from somewhere: which peers
// to dial, and which coordinator key to accept for storage leases.
//
// WHY THAT SECOND ONE IS THE DANGEROUS PART
// The two payloads carry very different risk. A bad peer costs a failed dial. A
// bad coordinator key means accepting forged storage leases indefinitely, with
// nothing to notice it. Historically a node read that key OUT of the document
// and trusted it, which meant whoever served the document chose it — fine while
// exactly one host under our own TLS served it, and not fine at all once the
// job is spread across volunteer gateways.
//
// THREE RULES, IN ORDER OF STRENGTH
//
//	key pinned          verify the signature; one good gateway is enough, and a
//	                    hostile one is simply ignored.
//	no key pinned       require agreement across several gateways before
//	                    believing anything. Weaker, and strictly better than
//	                    believing whoever answered first — which is the
//	                    behaviour this replaces.
//	pinned AND polled   disagreement becomes evidence: a gateway that served
//	                    something different from the signed document is
//	                    misbehaving, attributably.
//
// WHY CONSENSUS CANNOT REPLACE THE SIGNATURE
// To ask N parties, a node first needs a trustworthy list of who they are, and
// that list comes from DNS, which one party controls. A quorum over a
// DNS-chosen set is that party choosing the participants and therefore the
// answer. Gateways are volunteer-run, so a majority of them is a majority of
// whoever registered the most — the Sybil problem internal quorum rules already
// address by demanding distinct operators rather than counting signatures.
// Agreement is a useful second layer. It is not a first one.
