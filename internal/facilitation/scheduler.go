// The challenge scheduler: who challenges whom, in which epoch.
//
// Two problems it exists to solve.
//
// First, stampeding. If every node challenged every peer's every shard, load
// would grow with the square of the network and the challenges themselves would
// become the dominant traffic. Each (epoch, assignment) therefore has a small
// fixed set of designated challengers.
//
// Second, and the reason the selection is derived rather than chosen: a
// provider must not be able to arrange who audits it. The challenger set comes
// out of the same epoch randomness as witness selection, so it is fixed before
// the epoch's work happens, unpredictable to the provider, and recomputable by
// anyone auditing the result afterwards. A scheduler that picked its own targets
// would let a colluding pair agree to only ever challenge each other.
//
// Transport is injected. The p2p layer, an HTTP probe, or an in-memory pipe in
// tests all satisfy it, and none of the fairness logic here depends on which.

// ChallengersPerAssignment is how many nodes are designated to test each shard
// each epoch. Three is enough that one lazy or offline challenger does not mean
// a provider goes untested, without making auditing the network's main workload.
const ChallengersPerAssignment = 3

// ChunksPerChallenge is how many chunks a single challenge demands. Small
// enough to stay cheap over I2P, large enough that guessing is hopeless: a node
// holding half the shard passes a 4-chunk challenge only 1 time in 16.
