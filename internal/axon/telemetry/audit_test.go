// Package telemetry carries T16.3's audit: what a node may say about itself.
//
// It is a test-only package, like internal/axon/storage. There is nothing to
// build — the property is about what the EXISTING telemetry types are allowed to
// contain, and no runtime test of a working monitor establishes that.
//
// T16.3: "Metrics contain no per-circuit, per-name or per-peer identifier, by
// schema audit."
//
// §23's P16 card names the failure mode precisely: "monitoring that is useful
// precisely because it is deanonymising". The useful field and the dangerous
// field are the same field — which circuit was slow, which name failed to
// resolve, which peer timed out — so this cannot be left to judgement at the
// call site. It has to be a rule about the schema.
//
// WHAT IS ALLOWED. Aggregate counts and this node's own identity: how many
// objects, how many peers, how many placements failed, how long a probe took,
// and who is reporting. A node signs its reports, so its own id is attribution
// rather than surveillance, and removing it would make the reports unverifiable.
//
// WHAT IS NOT. Anything that names a THIRD PARTY or a UNIT OF WORK: a circuit
// id, a resolved name, an object or shard id, another peer's identity, an
// address. Each of those turns a health metric into a record of who did what.
