// LEVELLING THE POOLS: THE MOVER
// ==============================
// Placement picks the emptiest advertised peer and never revisits the decision.
// A node that joined early accumulates, a node that joined tonight stays nearly
// empty, and two peers were already refusing shards with "storage capacity
// exceeded" while six machines sat almost idle. Nothing rebalanced.
//
// This is the loop that does, and it is the LOWEST priority mover in the
// system: dispersal is racing to give an object its first remote copy, repair is
// restoring one that a dead node took away, and levelling is tidying. Every
// design decision below follows from that ranking.
//
// WHO MOVES WHAT
// --------------
// The mover runs on the OWNER of an object, not on the fat node. Only the owner
// has the placement ledger, so only the owner knows which peer holds a sibling
// of the chunk; only the owner can obtain a revocation, because the coordinator
// signs delete tokens for authorised origins; and only the owner can COPY before
// it deletes, because it is the one that can confirm the copy landed. A fat
// volunteer holds shard ids and nothing else -- it cannot tell which of its
// shards belong to the same chunk, so it could not shed one safely if it tried.
//
// The owner's own local copies are deliberately out of scope. Levelling here
// moves shards between REMOTE holders; draining a node's own disk is the
// operator-leaving case (roadmap phase 2b step 4), which is the same machinery
// with a target of zero and a different set of questions about what happens to
// the last copy.
//
// THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE WHOLE FEATURE
// --------------------------------------------
//	1. copy the shard to the destination and get the destination's confirmation;
//	2. VERIFY the copy with a fresh `have`, because a confirmation is a sentence
//	   and a probe is an observation;
//	3. re-read the ledger and prove the chunk is still durable with the source
//	   dropped;
//	4. only then mint a revocation and ask the source to delete;
//	5. and only credit the delete once the holder's claim has been re-checked,
//	   which recallFromPeer already does.
//
// A crash anywhere in that sequence leaves the shard on at least one peer, and
// usually on two. A duplicate is the safe direction; the reverse order has a
// window in which the only copy is in flight.
