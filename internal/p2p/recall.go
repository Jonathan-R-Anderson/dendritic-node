// SHARD RECALL OVER THE PEER PROTOCOL
// ===================================
// /syndichan/storage/1.0.0 dispatched four operations -- have, get,
// pof-challenge, store -- and answered "unsupported operation" to everything
// else. A shard that reached a peer could therefore never be taken back, so a
// purge on the site was local-only and honestly reported the remote copies as
// unreachable. This file adds the fifth verb.
//
// AUTHORISATION IS THE ENTIRE PROBLEM
// -----------------------------------
// An unauthenticated delete verb is strictly worse than no delete verb: any peer
// on the network could wipe every other peer's disk one shard at a time, and
// `have` already tells an attacker exactly which shard ids to ask for. So the
// verb reuses the ONLY authority a peer already trusts -- the coordinator's
// ed25519 key, the same key it verifies before accepting a `store`. Nothing new
// has to be distributed, pinned, or rotated: a node that can be written to can
// already be revoked from, at zero additional trust cost.
//
// WHY NOT JUST REUSE THE LEASE
// ----------------------------
// Because a lease is a capability to WRITE and its signed message covers exactly
// (version, object_id, shard_id, size, recipient, expires_at) -- the same fields
// a revocation needs. Signing a revocation with the lease's domain prefix would
// make every lease the coordinator has ever issued a valid delete token for that
// shard on that peer, and every lease travels over the wire in the clear inside
// a store frame. Anyone who ever observed a placement would hold a delete token
// for it.
//
// So a revocation is a DIFFERENT token:
//
//   - a different domain prefix, "syndichan-storage-revocation-v1";
//   - a different field set (issued_at and a nonce; no size), so the two
//     messages cannot collide even if a future refactor got the prefix wrong;
//   - a REQUIRED recipient. A lease may name an empty recipient, which means
//     "any peer may accept these bytes". That is safe for a write and unsafe for
//     a delete, so validateRevocation refuses an empty recipient outright: a
//     token minted against peer A is inert at peer B.
//   - a REQUIRED requester -- see below.
//
// BOTH ENDS ARE NAMED, AND FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
// ----------------------------------------------
// recipient binds the token to the peer that may HONOUR it. requester binds it
// to the peer that may PRESENT it. Without the second, a token is a bearer
// instrument: it travels the network in the clear inside a delete frame, so the
// holder it was aimed at -- or anything that observed the exchange -- could turn
// round and present the same bytes itself. Naming the requester inside the
// signed message and checking it against the authenticated peer on the other end
// of the libp2p stream makes a captured token inert in anyone else's hands.
//
// The requester is taken from stream.Conn().RemotePeer(), never from the frame.
// libp2p has already proved possession of that peer's private key during the
// security handshake; a peer id copied into the header would prove nothing at
// all, and an attacker would simply type the victim's id into it.
//
// WHAT A HOLDER CHECKS, IN ORDER
//   - the token is version 1 and signed by the coordinator key it already pins;
//   - object_id and shard_id equal the request header's, so a token for shard A
//     cannot delete shard B;
//   - recipient is this node and nothing else;
//   - requester is the authenticated peer that opened this stream;
//   - it has not expired, and its expiry is not absurdly far out;
//   - and only then, whether the shard may actually go (store.DeleteRemoteShard,
//     which refuses bytes another manifest still references).
//
// COMPATIBILITY, AND WHICH WAY IT FAILS
// -------------------------------------
// requester is inside the SIGNED message, so its arrival is a wire break in both
// directions -- deliberately, and both directions fail closed:
//
//   - an OLD holder given a NEW token reconstructs the message without the
//     requester line, so ed25519.Verify fails and it answers "invalid
//     coordinator revocation signature". It refuses to delete. Safe.
//   - a NEW holder given an OLD token sees an empty Requester, which can never
//     equal a real peer id, and refuses before it even reaches the signature.
//     An unbound token is never honoured by a node that knows about binding.
//
// Refusal is NOT terminal in the recall ledger (store.RecallRecord.Outstanding
// counts anything that is not deleted/absent), so the tombstone survives, the
// background pass retries every recallInterval, and a recall issued during the
// upgrade window completes on its own once the holders are new. Rollout order is
// therefore: sign first, upgrade holders after, and expect recalls against
// not-yet-upgraded holders to sit refused-and-retrying in the meantime.
//
// cacheOnly is deliberately NOT consulted. A cache-only node refuses new stores,
// but it can still be holding shards it accepted before the operator set that
// flag, and refusing to delete them because it refuses to accept new ones is
// exactly backwards.

// revocationURL is the coordinator endpoint that mints delete tokens. A var, so
// tests can point it at an httptest server, exactly like leaseURL.
var revocationURL = "https://syndichan.org/api/v1/storage/revocations"
