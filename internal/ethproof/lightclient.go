// Beacon header progression — roadmap P12-5.3.
//
// WHERE THE DEPENDENCY BOUNDARY IS
// --------------------------------
// Everything in this file is Ethereum concepts. The only cryptography it
// performs is SHA-256 through the SSZ code next door. The pairing check sits
// behind ONE interface method:
//
//	SyncCommitteeVerifier.VerifySyncCommitteeSignature(...)
//
// Nothing above that line touches a curve point, and nothing below it knows
// what a light client update is. That boundary is deliberate: it is what stops
// a caller reaching a raw pairing operation and skipping a validation step by
// accident, and it is why a vetted library can be swapped in without any of
// this code changing.
//
// WHAT IS CHECKED WITHOUT ANY SIGNATURE AT ALL
// --------------------------------------------
// Most of an update's validity is structural, and all of it is checkable now:
//
//	slot ordering            an update must move forward, and the signature
//	                         slot must be strictly after the attested slot
//	participation            below the threshold, a valid signature by a
//	                         handful of validators proves nothing useful
//	finality branch          the finalised header must be AT the right
//	                         generalized index in the attested state
//	committee branch         likewise for the next committee
//	committee identity       the committee used must be the one the
//	                         authenticated state already knows
//
// The signature is the last check, not the first, because it is the expensive
// one and because an update that fails any of the above is not worth verifying.
//
// THE ORDER THAT MATTERS
// ----------------------
// The committee comes from the AUTHENTICATED STATE, never from the update. An
// implementation that took the committee out of the same message it is checking
// would verify that the message is self-consistent, which is a property every
// forgery has.
