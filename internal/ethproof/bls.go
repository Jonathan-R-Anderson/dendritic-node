// The BLS boundary — roadmap P12-5.4.
//
// THIS IS THE ONLY FILE IN THE PROJECT THAT TOUCHES CURVE POINTS.
//
// Everything above it deals in sync committees, headers and slots. Everything
// below it is github.com/supranational/blst v0.3.17, Apache-2.0, vendored C and
// assembly behind cgo. The roadmap records the constraint that we do not write
// pairing, hash-to-curve, subgroup or cofactor code ourselves; this file is
// where that decision is spent.
//
// WHY THE WRAPPER VALIDATES KEYS ITSELF
// -------------------------------------
// blst's FastAggregateVerify does NOT subgroup-check public keys. Its own
// implementation aggregates with groupcheck=false and verifies with
// pkValidate=false; the only check it will perform on request is on the
// signature. Demonstrated rather than assumed — see doc/bls-library-evaluation.md:
//
//	infinity pubkey, KeyValidate()                 false   (rejected)
//	FastAggregateVerify with that key in the set   true    (accepted)
//
// The infinity point is the identity, so aggregating it changes nothing and the
// remaining members' signature still verifies — while the caller believes the
// whole set participated. That inflates apparent participation, which is the
// one number the 2/3 threshold exists to protect.
//
// So KeyValidate runs here, on every key, and the caller never has to remember
// it. A validation the caller can forget is a validation that will be forgotten.
//
// WHY VALIDATION IS CACHED PER COMMITTEE
// --------------------------------------
// 512 subgroup checks per update would dominate the cost of following the
// chain. A committee is fixed for a period (~27 hours), so it is validated once
// when first seen and the result is remembered against its hash tree root — not
// against a pointer, so a substituted committee with the same address cannot
// inherit an earlier committee's clean bill of health.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT ESTABLISH
// ---------------------------------
// That our ciphersuite matches Ethereum's. Signing and verifying against keys
// we generated proves the API works, not that mainnet validators produce
// signatures this accepts. Only consensus-spec vectors establish that, and
// P12-5.4 is not complete without them — see bls_vectors_test.go.
