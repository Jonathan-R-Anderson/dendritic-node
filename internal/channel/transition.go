// Transitions: the deterministic rule that turns a payment intent into the next
// state. SCPP/1 §4.2 and §5 — doc/channel-payment-protocol.md.
//
// WHY A TRANSITION IS A THING AND NOT JUST "THE NEXT STATE"
// --------------------------------------------------------
// Channel.Accept answers "is this state legal". That is not enough to accept a
// payment, because a legal state is not necessarily THE state the payment asked
// for. A payer could propose a perfectly conserved, perfectly signed state that
// moves a different amount than the one being discussed, and every check in
// Accept would pass.
//
// So a proposal carries the transition that produced it, and the payee recomputes:
//
//	Apply(stored latest, transition) == the state I was sent ?
//
// Byte-identical, not "equivalent". That single comparison is what makes a
// proposal unambiguous rather than merely valid.
//
// WHY THIS FUNCTION MUST BE PURE
// ------------------------------
// It is also what makes retries safe (§5). The same base state and the same
// transition must produce the same bytes on every machine, every time — so no
// clock, no randomness, no map iteration order, and lock ids chosen by the payer
// rather than generated here.
//
// The one thing it deliberately does NOT check is whether an expiry is in the
// future. See Channel.Accept's note: freshness is policy, decided by the layer
// that has a clock, because a validation that consults one would let two nodes
// with a little skew disagree about the same signed state.
