// The volunteer mailbox — roadmap P15.
//
// WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
// -----------------------
// A bilateral payment needs the recipient's signature at the moment it happens.
// That is why receiving a tip has, until now, meant running a node: something
// holding your key had to be reachable. Most people will never run a node, so
// most people could never be tipped.
//
// A mailbox is the smallest thing that fixes it without anybody becoming a
// custodian. A volunteer accepts frames addressed to a recipient and holds them
// until that recipient's own browser collects them, signs with their own wallet,
// and hands the replies back.
//
//	contributor ──frame──► volunteer mailbox ──held──► recipient's browser
//	                              ▲                          │ signs with
//	                              └──────reply───────────────┘ their own key
//
// WHY IT CANNOT STEAL
// -------------------
// It has no key. Not "it is not supposed to sign" — there is no field on this
// struct that could hold a signer, and a test asserts that by reflection. A
// mailbox that could sign would be a delegate, and delegation is a separate,
// explicit, on-chain thing (see delegate.go).
//
// It also holds no value: every frame it carries is a message between two other
// parties, and the contract pays neither of them on its say-so.
//
// WHAT IT NECESSARILY LEARNS
// --------------------------
// Who is talking to whom, and how often. A frame names a channel and a channel
// names both parties, so a mailbox serving many recipients sees the shape of
// their tipping. That is real and is NOT fixed by anything here; it is what
// onion-wrapping the terminal hop would address, and that is a later phase.
// Saying so plainly is better than implying a privacy this does not provide.
