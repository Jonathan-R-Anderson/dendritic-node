// Package channel is the seam between accounting and whichever payment-channel
// implementation is underneath.
//
// THE POINT OF THIS PACKAGE IS THAT IT IS SMALL
// ---------------------------------------------
// Every real channel protocol — Raiden, Nitro, Connext — has a large surface,
// and binding to any of it directly is how a project ends up unable to leave.
// The roadmap's central finding is that Raiden looks unmaintained, so the
// backend choice must stay reversible; that is only true if the interface above
// it is narrower than all of them and leaks none of their types.
//
// So: nothing above this package may import a backend's types, and nothing in
// this package may grow a method because one backend happens to offer it. A
// wider interface would leak that backend's model upward and quietly make it
// the only one that fits.
//
// WHY CAPABILITIES ARE REPORTED RATHER THAN ASSUMED
// -------------------------------------------------
// Backends differ in ways that change what the application may honestly offer.
// A backend without HTLCs cannot do service reservations or the viewer hub
// safely; one without adaptor signatures cannot do private routing without a
// globally correlating payment hash. Those are not performance differences,
// they are differences in what is TRUE about a payment.
//
// The rule this package enforces is therefore: the software must REFUSE to
// claim a property its backend does not support, never degrade quietly. It is
// the same rule the compute layer already follows for the `gpu` capability —
// claimed only when the mechanism works, because the alternative routes exactly
// the work that needs the property to something that cannot provide it.
