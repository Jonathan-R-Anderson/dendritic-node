// Multi-hop routing — roadmap P7-b.

// A hub forwards value it can never keep. That is the whole property, and it is
// what the HTLCs were integrated from the beginning for:
//
//	           ONE SECRET, TWO LOCKS
//	                   │
//	       ┌───────────┴───────────┐

//	  upstream lock           downstream lock
//	   A owes Hub              Hub owes B
//
// A's money moves only if the Hub can produce the secret. The Hub can only
// produce the secret because B revealed it to take the downstream payment. So
// the Hub is paid upstream exactly when it has paid downstream, and neither
// half can happen alone.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
// ---------------------
// It is not hub.go, which is still in this package and still wrong for this:
// that keeps its own map of reader and recipient balances in int64 and moves
// value between them. A hub with its own ledger is a custodian — it holds A's
// money and decides later whether B gets it. Nothing here holds anything. Every
// movement is a co-signed V2 state on an ordinary bilateral channel, and the
// forwarding is only ever an ORDERING of those.
//
// THE TWO WAYS A HUB LOSES MONEY, AND WHY NEITHER CAN HAPPEN
// ----------------------------------------------------------
//	paid downstream, cannot claim upstream
//	    the secret is persisted before the downstream settle is signed
//	    (see preimages.go), and the upstream lock outlives the downstream
//	    one by a margin this file enforces.
//
//	paid upstream, not paid downstream
//	    impossible by construction: the upstream claim REQUIRES the secret,
//	    and the secret only exists downstream once B has taken the money.
