// The deployment gate, as code — roadmap P12.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A CHECKLIST IN A DOCUMENT
// -----------------------------------------
// P10 produced a challengePeriod of 8 hours from eight terms, seven of which
// are estimates about a network nobody has run this against. The figure may
// well be right. What is certainly true is that nobody has checked, and the
// value is immutable once deployed.
//
// A document saying "validate before deploying" is a document somebody reads
// once. This makes the rule mechanical:
//
//	DeployableChallengePeriod() returns an ERROR until every term that makes a
//	claim about the world has evidence behind it.
//
// So the deployment script cannot get a number to deploy with, and the failure
// says which terms are still guesses. That is the whole of P12's contribution
// to safety — the rest is the measuring, which needs a chain.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS EVIDENCE
// -----------------------
// A measurement, its sample count, the chain it was taken on and how. Not a
// tick in a box: "we validated inclusion" is not checkable, and an assertion
// nobody can check is the thing this exists to replace.
//
// Evidence must also SUPPORT the budgeted value. A measurement showing
// inclusion takes 45 minutes does not validate a 30-minute budget — it refutes
// it, and the correct response is to raise the term and re-derive, not to
// record the measurement and carry on.
