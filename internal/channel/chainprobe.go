// Measuring the chain terms of the challenge budget — roadmap P12.
//
// validation.go refuses to produce a deployable challengePeriod until every
// term that makes a claim about the world has evidence. This is how two of
// those claims get measured, and — as importantly — it is where the ones that
// CANNOT be measured this way are written down.
//
//	reorg depth   measurable here, read-only, by watching the head
//	rpc failure   measurable here, read-only, by watching the endpoints
//
//	inclusion     Not measurable READ-ONLY. Needs transactions actually sent on
//	repricing     the target chain from a funded account, because the thing
//	              being measured is what the network does with a real
//	              transaction. A read-only probe can observe fee markets and
//	              block times, which is context, not evidence.
//
//	              InclusionObservation below therefore only SCORES a run that
//	              something else performed; it deliberately cannot broadcast.
//	              Keeping the spending out of this file is what stops a probe
//	              from quietly acquiring a funded key.
//
//	detection     measurable, but by running the watchtower at the channel
//	              count this deployment will hold — not by asking the chain.
//	outage        an operational commitment, not a property of any network.
//
// Guessing at the four unmeasurable ones from the two measurable ones would be
// exactly the move the gate exists to stop.
