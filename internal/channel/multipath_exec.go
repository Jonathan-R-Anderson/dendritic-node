// Executing a SplitPlan — the P13 multi-path executor.
//
// THE ONE DESIGN DECISION EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS FROM
// ----------------------------------------------------
// This keeps NO record of who is owed what. It cannot: a second place that
// believes it knows the money is a second thing to be wrong, and the first
// symptom of divergence is a payment that exists in one and not the other.
//
//	channels          the ONLY source of truth for money
//	journal (here)    what was ATTEMPTED — never what succeeded
//
// The journal records the fragments of one payment and the intent bytes each
// leg will carry. Nothing else. Status is always DERIVED by asking each channel
// whether it applied that intent, so a crashed process cannot mislead its
// successor: the successor never reads a belief, it re-reads the chain of
// signed states.
//
// That is what makes recovery honest rather than hopeful. A journal saying
// "fragment 2 settled" would be a claim; Channel.AppliedAt(intent) is a fact.
//
// IDEMPOTENCY AND ISOLATION COME FROM THE SAME PLACE
// ---------------------------------------------------
// Every leg's intent is derived deterministically:
//
//	intent_i = H(domain || paymentID || i || channel || amount)
//
// Retrying produces identical bytes, so Coordinator.Pay answers from its record
// instead of paying again — the engine was already idempotent on intent and
// this inherits it rather than reimplementing it. Two different fragments
// derive different intents, so no leg's authorisation can move another.
//
// PER-FRAGMENT PREIMAGES, BOUND TO THE FRAGMENT
// ---------------------------------------------
// One payment secret, but each fragment locks a DIFFERENT hash:
//
//	preimage_i = H(domain || secret || intent_i)
//	hash_i     = keccak(preimage_i)
//
// The recipient holds the secret, so it can open every fragment — which is what
// makes the payment atomic from their side. But preimage_i opens only fragment
// i, so revealing one does not drain the rest.
//
// THE INTENT, NOT JUST THE INDEX. An earlier version derived this from
// (secret, index) alone, and adversarial review broke it twice:
//
//   - ACROSS PAYMENTS. Two payments sharing a secret produced the SAME hash for
//     fragment i, because the payment id lived in the intent but not in the
//     hash. A counterparty that legitimately learned preimage_0 from one payment
//     could settle fragment 0 of another. Verified as working theft.
//   - ACROSS RE-SPLITS. unevenSplit draws fresh random weights every call, so
//     retrying a payment after a refused leg yields different amounts. The amount
//     is in the intent, so intents and lock ids changed — but the hash did not,
//     leaving two same-hash locks the payee could settle twice. Nothing dedupes
//     HTLC.Hash: state.go permits two locks sharing one deliberately, for
//     exactly the multipath case.
//
// intent_i already commits to payment id, index, channel and amount, so binding
// the preimage to it closes both. The recipient can still derive every preimage:
// it knows the channel and amount of any leg it is party to.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
// -----------------------------------
// It does not sign, does not touch balances, and does not construct states. It
// composes StateTransitions and hands them to Coordinator.Pay, which goes
// through the session, the store and Channel.Accept exactly as a direct payment
// does. There is no aggregate write path, and row 25 of the security table
// stays true by construction rather than by care.

// routed payments safe for intermediaries.
