// Asking a volunteer whether anything is waiting — roadmap P15.5.
//
// WHY THIS IS A NODE CAPABILITY AND NOT A BROWSER ONE
// ----------------------------------------------------
// Only the recipient can authorise a read of the recipient's mailbox, and the
// recipient's channel key lives in their node — that is the entire point of
// mailbox mode, which exists so somebody can be tipped while their browser is
// closed. A page cannot produce this proof without holding that key, and a page
// holding that key would be a page with custody.
//
// The alternative that was NOT taken was a wallet-signed peek from the browser:
// it would work, and it would train recipients to approve signature prompts for
// a read, on a page whose only job is to display a number. The node already has
// the authority; it should use it.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO
// ------------------------------
// Discovery only. It reads, and reading is all it can do:
//
//   - it calls /mailbox/v1/peek, never /collect, so the proposal survives
//     the read and is still there when the recipient decides;
//   - it never accepts, countersigns, or commits — acceptance stays where it
//     was, on the recipient's own explicit action through Store.Accept;
//   - it returns frames verbatim and parses no payments.
//
// The signature it produces covers a mailbox challenge, which is not a channel
// state digest and cannot be replayed as one: state digests are domain-tagged
// with an operation byte and computed over the channel, and this is neither.
