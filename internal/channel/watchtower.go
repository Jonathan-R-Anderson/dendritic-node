// Defending a channel whose owner is not watching — roadmap P10.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY THIS EXISTS FOR
// -----------------------------
// A recipient's node is online; it can watch its own channels. A tipper is a
// person who opened a browser tab:
//
//	make one tip  ->  close the tab  ->  leave for six months
//
// Nobody in that sequence is watching the chain. But `closeUnilateral` lets
// either party put a state on chain and start a clock, and if a STALE state
// wins that clock the difference is simply taken. A payment system whose safety
// depends on the payer staying awake is not a payment system.
//
// So somebody else has to be able to defend the channel. The contract makes
// that possible by NOT restricting `challenge` to the parties — it checks the
// signatures, not the sender — which means a watchtower needs no key of the
// party it defends and can never move their money anywhere except where they
// already signed it.
//
// WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DO
// -------------------------
//	can:     submit a state both parties already signed
//	cannot:  create a state, alter one, or pay itself
//
// The worst a hostile watchtower can do is nothing at all — which is exactly
// what happens if there is no watchtower, so delegating to one is never worse
// than not having one. That is the property that makes this safe to hand out.
//
// WHY IT POLLS THE CHAIN RATHER THAN WATCHING EVENTS
// -------------------------------------------------
// An event is a notification; the mapping is the fact. A watchtower that had
// been down for an hour, or whose log subscription silently dropped, would have
// no way to discover a close it had missed — and "silently dropped" is the
// normal failure mode of a websocket subscription. Polling costs one eth_call
// per channel per interval and cannot miss a close that is still open.
//
// It also means detection latency is a NUMBER THIS FILE CHOOSES rather than a
// property of somebody's RPC provider, which matters because that number goes
// into challengePeriod.
