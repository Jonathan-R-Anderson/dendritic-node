// Composing a private payment out of the pieces.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY
// --------------------------
// Route selection, locks, the onion and the invoice were each built and tested
// alone. Alone is not the hard part: the ordering between them is. The locks
// must be built before the onion because each hop's instruction carries its own
// commitment; the route must be chosen before the locks because the lock count
// depends on the hop count; and the invoice must be validated before any of it,
// because an expired invoice discovered after three hops of work is three hops
// wasted and a lock chain to unwind.
//
// So the ordering lives here once, rather than in every caller.
//
// PLAN, THEN SEND
// ---------------
// Plan() does everything that can fail cheaply and locally: validating the
// invoice, drawing a diverse route, checking the amount, building locks and
// sealing the onion. It touches no network and moves no money.
//
// That split is deliberate. Every reason a private payment cannot be made —
// no diverse operators, expired invoice, amount out of range — is knowable
// BEFORE anything is committed, and a caller that learns them one hop at a time
// leaks its intent to each hop it asks.
