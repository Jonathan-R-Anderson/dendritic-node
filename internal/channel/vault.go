// State availability for a watchtower — roadmap P11.
//
// A watchtower can only submit a state it holds. P10 answered "how fast can a
// stale close be beaten"; this answers "with what", and the answer has to
// arrive continuously, from a party, to a service that is not one.
//
// THE INVARIANT: EVIDENCE, NOT AUTHORITY
// --------------------------------------
// A vault holds enough to DEFEND a channel and nothing that could be used to
// change it:
//
//	holds:      fully co-signed states, which anyone may verify and submit
//	never has:  a private key, the ability to alter a state, the ability to
//	            sign one, or any say in what a channel is worth
//
// This is not a matter of the vault choosing to behave. It is structural: the
// only thing it stores is a state both parties already signed, and the only
// thing it can do with one is hand it to a contract that checks those
// signatures. A hostile vault's entire power is to do nothing — which is what
// happens with no vault at all.
//
// So a party may hand their states to a stranger's watchtower and be no worse
// off than keeping them to themselves. That property is what makes the whole
// delegation model workable, and every check below exists to preserve it.
//
// WHY IT VERIFIES INSTEAD OF TRUSTING
// -----------------------------------
// "Here is the latest state" is a claim. A vault that stored claims would be a
// vault that could be filled with garbage by anyone who found its address, and
// would then have nothing to submit when it mattered.
//
// It cannot ask a party to vouch for a state — the party who submits it may be
// the one attacking. So the deposits and the parties come from the CHAIN, which
// is invariant P5-1 arriving at a third component for the same reason it
// applied to the first two: a channel's collateral is never established from
// peer-provided data.
//
// WHY IT ONLY EVER MOVES FORWARD
// ------------------------------
// A vault that accepted a lower nonce could be walked backwards by an attacker
// who replayed an old state just before closing on it. Monotonic per channel,
// strictly — which is the same rule the contract's `challenge` applies, and for
// the same reason.
