// Payout — roadmap P6 settlement. Turning accumulated off-chain value into on-chain
// value.
//
// THE SAME TRUST MODEL AS COLLATERAL
// ----------------------------------
// P5-1 fixed where a deposit comes from: the chain, never a peer. This applies
// the identical rule to settlement. Whether a channel is settled, and at what
// state, is a question for ChannelManagerV2 — never for a local record of what
// this node believes it broadcast.
//
// That is not tidiness. It is the only thing that makes the worst case
// answerable: a node that died between broadcasting and recording genuinely
// cannot know what it did, but it can always ask.
//
//	broadcast → CRASH → restart → read the contract
//	                                 Settled  → done
//	                                 Open     → it did not land
//	                                 Closing  → a close is in its window
//
// So the Settlement record below is for humans and dashboards. The worker never
// decides anything from it that the chain could be asked about instead.
//
// SUBMITTED IS NOT CONFIRMED
// --------------------------
// The same distinction the transport layer makes, one layer down:
//
//	TCP write succeeded    ≠  payment completed
//	transaction broadcast  ≠  settlement completed
//
// Collapsing them is how a worker reports a settlement because it managed to
// send something. They are separate phases here and the worker moves between
// them only on a chain read.
//
// LOCKS FIRST
// -----------
// ChannelManagerV2.settle reverts with LocksOutstanding while any lock is
// unresolved, and cannot simply hand them back: a lock whose expiry has not
// arrived may still be claimed with the preimage, and refunding it early would
// steal a payment that is legitimately in flight. So the worker resolves locks
// before it settles, and refuses rather than forcing.
