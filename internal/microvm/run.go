//
// WHY TEARDOWN IS THE HARD PART
// -----------------------------
// Spec layer 11 says the VM is destroyed after every job. That is easy when the
// guest cooperates and is the whole problem when it does not: a hostile payload
// has every reason to ignore a shutdown request and keep the slot, and a
// volunteer who finds a stuck VM eating a core is a volunteer who uninstalls
// the node.
//
// So there is no cooperative path here at all. The context deadline fires and
// the process is killed. Firecracker holds the guest entirely inside one host
// process — kill it and the vCPU threads, the memory mapping and the devices go
// with it — which is exactly why the VMM boundary is also the cleanup boundary.
//
// The kill is by PROCESS GROUP. Firecracker itself is well-behaved, but a
// runner that only signals the direct child leaves anything it spawned running,
// and "mostly cleaned up" is indistinguishable from "leaking one process per
// job" until the machine has a thousand of them.
